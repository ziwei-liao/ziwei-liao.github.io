## Biography
Hello, I am Ziwei, currently a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in computer vision and robotics from the University of Toronto. I studied at the [Toronto Robotics and AI Lab](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/) supervised by [Prof. Steven L. Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander). I am affiliated with the [Institute for Aerospace Study (UTIAS)](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/), [UToronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

<!-- Starting in June 2024, I joined [Niantic Labs](https://nianticlabs.com/), in London, UK, as a research intern. Niantic developed the AR game PokÃ©mon GO and is a leading tech company in 3D mapping.  -->
I was fortunate to cooperated with researchers at [Niantic Labs](https://nianticlabs.com/) in London, UK, in 2024, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA) in 2023, and [Megvii Research](https://en.megvii.com/) (Face++) in 2021 as a research intern. 

In 2021 and 2018, I received both my M.Sci. and B.E. at the Robotics Institute of [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, supervised by Prof. Wang Wei. In 2017, I visited the [Intelligent Robot Laboratory](https://www.roboken.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) at Tsukuba University, Japan as a research assistant supervised by Prof. Akihisa Ohya.


Please refer to my [[CV]](/files/ZiweiLiao_CV.pdf) for more details.

<span style="color:red;">
I will graduate before August 2025 and am actively seeking job opportunities in World Models/Generative AI, Embodied AI/Robotics, AR/XR, and other related fields. Please feel free to contact me via email. Thank you!

## Research Interests

<!-- My long-term goal is to make robots and machines perceive, understand, and interact with 3D environments to help humans in the real world. My past research focuses on 3D vision and learning, including: -->

My research focuses on the intersection of 3D vision, generative models, and computer graphics. I am interested in building a world model, which is essential for enabling machines to perceive, understand, and interact with real-world 3D environments. It has broad applications in physical embodied AI, including robotics and augmented reality. More specifically:

* **3D Representations for Objects and Scenes**: Gaussian Splattings and Implicit representations (e.g., NeRF, SDF), with applications in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), objects reconstruction, and pose estimation.

* **3D Generative Modellings**: Learning to generate 3D representations from images using diffusion models; Solving ill-posed inverse problems by leveraging generative models as priors and quantifying uncertainty.

* **Learning for 3D Perception Tasks**: Developing multi-view learning architectures (e.g., Transformers) for 3D perception tasks such as human pose estimation, while enhancing generalization capabilities.


If you are interested in any of these topics, please don't hesitate to reach out to me for discussion and potential collaboration.

I have been a huge enthusiast of robotics throughout my college years.
I was the vice captain of the Robot Team at Beihang University, participating in the Robocon National Robotics Competition (2016-2018). 
I designed a rotorcraft equipped with a master-slave mechanical arm (2015). 
I had the opportunity to work with various robots during both my bachelor's and master's projects (2018, 2021). 
I served as the president of the Robotics Student Association at Beihang University (2015-2016).
