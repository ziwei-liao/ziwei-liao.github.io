## Biography
Hello, I am Ziwei, currently a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in computer vision and robotics from the University of Toronto. I studied at the [Toronto Robotics and AI Lab](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/) supervised by [Prof. Steven L. Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander). I am affiliated with the [Institute for Aerospace Study (UTIAS)](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/), [UToronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

Starting in June 2024, I joined [Niantic Labs](https://nianticlabs.com/), in London, UK, as a research intern. Niantic developed the AR game Pok√©mon GO and is a leading tech company in 3D mapping. 
I was also fortunate to have cooperated with researchers at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA), and [Megvii Research](https://en.megvii.com/) (Face++) as a research intern. 

In 2021 and 2018, I received my M.Sci. and B.E. at the Robotics Institute of [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, supervised by Prof. Wang Wei. In 2017, I visited the [Intelligent Robot Laboratory](https://www.roboken.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) at Tsukuba University, Japan as a research assistant supervised by Prof. Akihisa Ohya.

Please refer to my [[CV]](/files/ZiweiLiao_CV.pdf) for more details.

<span style="color:red;">I will graduate before August 2025 and am open to positions in 3D, GenAI, Robotics, AR, and other relevant areas. Please feel free to send me an email. Thank you!</span>

## Research Interests

Keywords: 3D Vision, Robotics, Deep Learning

My long-term goal is to make robots and machines perceive, understand, and interact with 3D environments to help humans in the real world. My past research focuses on 3D vision and learning, including:

* **3D Representations for Objects and Scenes**: Implicit representations (e.g., NeRF, SDF), Gaussian Splattings, and their applications in mapping and localization (SLAM), object reconstruction, and pose estimation from sensor observations.

* **Learning with Generative Priors and Uncertainty**: Learning to solve ill-posed inverse problems with generative models (e.g., VAE, Diffusion) as prior knowledge, with applications in sparse-view reconstruction under partial observations, uncertainty estimation, and multi-view learning formulation (e.g., Transformers).

If you are also interested in any of the topics, please feel free to contact me for discussion and collaboration.

## Academic Service

I am serving as a reviewer for:

* Journal: The International Journal of Robotics Research
(IJRR), IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) 
* Conference: ICLR 2025; ICRA 2024, 2023; NeurIPS 2024; CVPR 2024, 2023; ECCV 2024; WACV 2024, 2025;
