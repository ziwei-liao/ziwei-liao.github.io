## Biography
Hi! I am Ziwei Liao, currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Toronto Robotics & AI Lab](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/) supervised by [Prof. Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander), at the Institute for Aerospace Study (UTIAS), University of Toronto, Canada. I am also affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), and the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/).

I was fortunate to have cooperated with researchers at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA), and [Megvii Research](https://en.megvii.com/) (Face++). 


I received my M.Sci. at the Autonomous Robots Lab, supervised by Prof. Wang Wei, at the Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation of [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. 

I received my B.E. in Mechatronics Engineering from Beihang University, where I also visited the [Intelligent Robot Laboratory](https://www.roboken.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) at Tsukuba University, Japan as a research assistant supervised by Prof. Akihisa Ohya.

Please refer to my [[CV]](/files/ZiweiLiao_CV.pdf) for more details.

## Research Interests

Keywords: 3D Vision, SLAM, Robotics, Deep Learning

My long-term goal is to make intelligent robots and machines perceive, understand, and interact with real environments to help human beings in the real world. To achieve that, my research concentrates on visual perception and learning as following:

**3D Objects and Scenes**: My research areas cover mapping and localization (SLAM), pose estimation, and reconstruction, with a focus on 3D common objects.

**Learning with 3D geometry**: I am interested in the combination of geometrics and learning-based methods, such as Neural Radience Fields (NeRF), Generative Models as 3D shape priors (e.g., VAE, Diffusion), learning frameworks for multi-view and 3D (e.g., Transformers), and modeling of the distribution and uncertainty.

If you are also interested, feel free to contact me for a small talk or collaboration!
