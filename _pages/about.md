## Biography
Hi, welcome! I am Ziwei Liao, currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in computer vision and robotics, at the [Toronto Robotics & AI Lab](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/), Institute for Aerospace Study (UTIAS), University of Toronto, supervised by [Prof. Steven L. Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander). I am affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), and the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/).

Starting in June 2024, I joined [Niantic Labs](https://nianticlabs.com/), in London, UK, as a research intern. Niantic Labs is a leader in augmented reality technology and developed Pok√©mon GO. 
Besides, I was fortunate to have cooperated with researchers at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) (MSRA), and [Megvii Research](https://en.megvii.com/) (Face++). 


In 2021, I received my M.Sci. at the Autonomous Robots Lab, supervised by Prof. Wang Wei, at the Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation of [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. 

In 2018, I received my B.E. in Mechatronics Engineering from Beihang University, where I also visited the [Intelligent Robot Laboratory](https://www.roboken.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) at Tsukuba University, Japan as a research assistant supervised by Prof. Akihisa Ohya.

Please refer to my [[CV]](/files/ZiweiLiao_CV.pdf) for more details.

<span style="color:red;">I will be graduating with my Ph.D. in August 2025 and am open to full-time positions in AI, Robotics, AR and more. Please feel free to send me an email. Thank you!</span>


## Research Interests

Keywords: 3D Vision, SLAM, Robotics, Deep Learning

My long-term goal is to make intelligent robots and machines perceive, understand, and interact with real environments to help human beings in the real world. To achieve that, my research concentrates on visual perception and learning as following:

**3D Objects and Scenes**: My research areas cover mapping and localization (SLAM), pose estimation, and reconstruction, with a focus on 3D common objects.

**Learning with 3D geometry**: I am interested in the combination of geometrics and learning-based methods, such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, Generative Models as 3D shape priors (e.g., VAE, Diffusion), learning frameworks for multi-view and 3D (e.g., Transformers), and modeling of the distribution and uncertainty.

If you are also interested, feel free to contact me for a small talk or collaboration!
