## Biography
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Toronto Robotics & AI Lab](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/) at the Institute for Aerospace Study (UTIAS), University of Toronto, supervised by [Prof. Steven Waslander](https://www.trailab.utias.utoronto.ca/stevenwaslander), starting from Sep 2021.

In June 2021, I got my master degree at the Robotics Institute of [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, supervised by Prof. Wei Wang. In 2018, I received the B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Beihang University. 

In 2018, I joined the SLAM Group of Megvii (Face++) Ltd., Co., China as an algorithm researcher intern.

In 2017, I exchanged to the Tsukuba University, Japan and became a research assistant at the [Intelligent Robot Labrotory](https://www.roboken.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/) supervised by Prof. Akihisa Ohya.

Please refer to my [[CV]](/files/ZiweiLiao_CV.pdf) for more details.

## Research Interests
My research interests include SLAM, computer vision and robotics, aiming to make intelligent robots perceive, understand and interact with real environments. 

Recently I am concentrating on developing novel visual perception system, with Neural Implicit Representation to model 3D objects and scenes for semantic scene understanding, which is potential for future applications in autonomous robots, robotics manipulation, AR&MR etc.
